# Treehouse - Agent Guide

## What is this?

Treehouse is a Go CLI tool that manages a pool of git worktrees for parallel AI coding agent workflows. It maintains reusable, pre-warmed worktrees so agents get isolated environments instantly.

## Project Structure

- `main.go` - entry point, calls `cmd.Execute()`
- `cmd/` - CLI commands (cobra): `get`, `return`, `status`, `prune`, `destroy`
- `internal/config/` - config file loading (`treehouse.toml`)
- `internal/hooks/` - user-configured lifecycle hook command execution
- `internal/pool/` - pool manager (acquire, release, list, destroy, prune) + state file
- `internal/git/` - git operations (shells out to `git` binary)
- `internal/process/` - in-use detection and lingering process termination for worktrees
- `internal/shell/` - subshell spawning
- `internal/ui/` - Y/n confirmation prompts

## Building

```sh
go build -o treehouse .
# or
make build
```

## Testing

```sh
go test ./...
# or
make test
```

## Key Design Decisions

- No daemon - all operations are inline CLI commands
- Detached HEAD worktrees reset to whichever of local or origin default branch is further ahead (prefers origin on divergence)
- In-use detection uses process scanning plus short-lived persisted owner reservations for lifecycle operations
- Dirty checks include untracked files even when repository config hides them from normal `git status` output
- Prune deletes only idle managed worktrees that are clean and whose HEAD is merged into the default branch; dry run is the default
- Global prune enumerates managed pool directories under the user-level treehouse root and derives each worktree's owning repository from git metadata instead of relying on the current directory
- Global prune loads user-level config and hooks only because it can run without a repository context
- State file tracks pool membership and temporary owner/destroy reservations, not long-term usage status
- Git operations shell out to `git` (go-git has incomplete worktree support)
- Self-healing: stale state entries are auto-removed

## Windows Compatibility

This project targets Linux, macOS, and Windows. All new code **must** work on Windows. Follow these rules:

- **Paths**: Never hardcode `/` as a path separator. Use `filepath.Join()`, `filepath.Separator`, or `filepath.ToSlash()` as appropriate.
- **Shell**: Do not assume `/bin/sh` or `$SHELL` exist. On Windows, use `%COMSPEC%` (usually `cmd.exe`). See `internal/shell/shell.go` for the pattern.
- **Syscalls**: Unix-only syscalls (e.g., `syscall.Flock`) must be isolated behind build tags (`//go:build !windows` / `//go:build windows`). See `internal/pool/lock_unix.go` and `lock_windows.go` for the pattern.
- **Build tags**: Follow the existing `_unix.go` / `_windows.go` naming convention (see also `internal/updater/sysproc_*.go`).
- **CI**: The CI matrix runs tests on `ubuntu`, `macOS`, and `windows`. Cross-compile locally with `GOOS=windows go build ./...` to catch issues early.
- **Process detection**: `gopsutil` is cross-platform - no special handling needed, but avoid importing platform-specific process APIs directly.

## Config

Place repo-safe settings in repo root `treehouse.toml` or user-level `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`:

```toml
max_trees = 16

# Optional worktree root.
# Relative roots need a repo context; use an absolute user-level root for global prune.
# root = "$HOME/worktrees"

# User-level config only:
[hooks]
post_create = ["./scripts/setup-venv.sh"]
pre_destroy = ["./scripts/teardown.sh"]
```

Hooks are ignored in repo-level config for safety.
